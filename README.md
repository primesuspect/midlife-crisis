# midlife-crisis
As a midlife crisis project, re-learn how to code. I did is as a kid, I should be able to do it as an adult. 

Also, my entire career trajectory has been derailed by late-stage capitalism. I have spent 20 years in comms, marketing, and social media, and kind of niche'd myself into a corner. I found myself leaning into Developer Relations roles, but have hit a roadblock since many companies that are hiring for DevRel or developer community roles want you to have demonstrated coding experience as well as the mastery of comms and social media / community skills, and while I've mastered the latter, the former is not something I can confidently point to. Yet.
